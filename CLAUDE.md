# Scale AI Take Home Assignment - Claims Processing Tool

## Assignment Context

This project is a **Scale AI take-home assignment** focused on building an AI-powered car insurance claims experience that increases efficiency and accuracy at lower cost.

### Objective
Assess ability to define product vision, rapidly prototype using AI coding tools, and document effectively while leveraging emerging technologies to build and communicate product ideas.

### Scenario
Working with a leading car insurance company to automate the manual claims assessment workflow, specifically the flow between damage documentation and estimate generation.

## Target Workflow to Automate

**Current Manual Process:**
1. **Manual Review and Assessment**: Claims agents manually review submitted photos/videos
2. **Damage Assessment**: Assess extent of damage (scratches, dents, structural damage)
3. **Cost Estimation**: Use experience and knowledge to estimate repair costs, consulting standardized databases
4. **Estimate Generation**: Generate detailed repair cost estimates
5. **Approval and Authorization**: Senior claims adjuster reviews and approves estimates

**Our AI-Powered Solution:** Automate steps 1-3 while keeping human oversight for steps 4-5.

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. Prototype Requirements
- **Core User Flow**: Functional prototype for claims agent workflow
- **Key Features**:
  - Basic UI for initiating claims
  - Image upload functionality for vehicle damage
  - Simulated AI-generated damage assessment and next steps
  - Demonstration of AI integration potential

### 2. PRD Requirements (3 pages max)
- **Vision**: Product vision and goals
- **User Stories**: Key user stories for claims agents
- **Key Features**: Essential features of AI-powered claims solution
- **Prioritization**: Feature prioritization rationale
- **Success Metrics**: KPIs to measure product success
- **AI Integration**: High-level approach for AI damage assessment and human↔AI interaction

### 3. Time Constraints
- **Maximum 3-4 hours total**
- Focus on core workflow, not additional features
- Prioritize UX (how it works) over UI polish (how it looks)
- Build thoughtful features that solve user problems

## Evaluation Criteria

### Prototype Assessment
- Functionality and user flow quality
- Effective use of AI coding tools
- Clear demonstration of AI integration potential

### PRD Assessment
- Clarity and conciseness of writing
- Alignment between prototype and design
- Strong product thinking and prioritization
- Relevant KPIs and ethical considerations
- Thoughtful AI integration including human↔AI interaction

### Presentation
- Live walkthrough of PRD/prototype
- Ability to back up every decision made
- Demonstrate understanding of scoping vague projects

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features
✅ **Multi-Claim Dashboard**: Sidebar navigation with active/approved claims, priority indicators
✅ **Advanced Photo Viewer**: Category-based organization, AI damage highlighting, annotation tools
✅ **AI Damage Analysis**: Damage categorization, severity assessment, confidence scoring
✅ **Cost Estimation Module**: Automated repair cost breakdowns with agent overrides
✅ **Review & Approval Workflow**: Single-click approvals, audit trails, case details

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL/Neon ready)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Routing**: Wouter

### Key User Stories Addressed
1. **AI-Assisted Review**: Claims agents see automated damage analysis alongside photos with override capabilities
2. **Damage Assessment**: AI provides categorized damage (minor/moderate/severe) with confidence scores
3. **Cost Estimation**: AI-generated repair estimates from trusted sources with manual adjustment
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete inputs and audit trails for senior adjustor review
